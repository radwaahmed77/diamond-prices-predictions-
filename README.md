# diamond-prices-predictions-
Developed a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. Utilized data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression techniques to train the model. Deployed the model using Flask, enabling real-time predictions through a simple web interface.
